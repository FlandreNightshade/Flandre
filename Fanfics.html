  <p>Love and hate were two sides of the same coin. Two polar opposite emotions yet so intertwined that it would be impossible to feel one without also feeling another. To me, I could not hate someone that I had not loved. I could not love someone without also having the capacity to hate them. </p>

<p>I did not hate people. In fact, for the average person that I met and had any sort of relationship with, I just didn’t feel much about them. Whether that relationship be acquaintances, friends, strangers, or anything outside and in between. If I did not feel deeply connected to them on a personal level I just did not feel any strong emotions towards them. </p>

<p>To say that I loved my friends would be incorrect. I could go hours, days, weeks, months or even years without talking to them. Yet when we finally reunited I would be able to jump back into it like nothing had ever happened. </p>

<p>But when I loved someone? I needed them. I craved their attention, like an addict going through withdrawal. Their emotions became my emotions and their frustrations clashed with mine. It wasn’t enough that they just agreed with me on things, or they tolerated me. They needed to understand me. To acknowledge me. To show me that I wasn’t just some random face in their life and that I had a deep, impactful, meaningful place in their hearts. To know that I existed as a person in someone else’s life. </p>
